# Gele Radio

Bug fixed and updated OranjeRadio with Spectrum Analyzer and choice of Filesystem and
optional Gestures or Touchscreen.
<p />
User friendly install of VS1053 plugins and patches, just upload the .plg 
files to your SPIFFS/LittleFS/FFat flash disk.
<p />
An effort has been made to maximize use of PSRAM, if available.
<p />


Still a work in progress. Touchscreen is waiting to be implemented

<p />

Gele Radio uses the follwing libraries:
 wifi manager ( https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager.git )
 Gesture_PAJ7620 ( https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Gesture_PAJ7620 )
 ESP_VS1053 ( https://github.com/baldram/ESP_VS1053_Library )
 TFT_eSPI ( https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI )
 If you want to use LittleFS
 LittleFS_ESP32 ( https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS )
<p />

Grateful use has been made of the spectrum analyzer code of blotfi at

Thanks to all the authors
