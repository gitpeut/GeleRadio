# GeleRadioGH

Bug fixed and updated OranjeRadio with optional Filesystem, Gestures, Touchscreen.

User friendly install of VS1053 plugins and patches, just upload the .plg 
files to your SPIFFS/LittleFS/FFat flash disk.

An effort has been made to maximize use of PSRAM, if available.

Still a work in progress.
