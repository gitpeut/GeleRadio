# GeleRadioGH

Bug fixed and updated OranjeRadio with Sepctrum Analyzer and choice of Filesystem and
optional Gestures or Touchscreen.

User friendly install of VS1053 plugins and patches, just upload the .plg 
files to your SPIFFS/LittleFS/FFat flash disk.

An effort has been made to maximize use of PSRAM, if available.

Still a work in progress.
